# ANN Implementation using JAVA for MNIST data set

Accuracy: 85 - 97 % (when random weight value is superb)
	epoch = 1
	Learning rate = 0.1
	Number of input = 28*28
	Number of output = 10
	Number of hidden = (num of input + num of output)/2
	momentum is not implemented
	Batch is not implemented
	
Accuracy: 90 - 97 % (when random weight value is superb)
	Same except epoch (epoch = 10)
	
Accuracy: 97 %
	Same except epoch (epoch = 100)
